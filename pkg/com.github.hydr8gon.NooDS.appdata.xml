      The goal of NooDS is to be a fast and portable Nintendo DS emulator. It's not quite there speed-wise, but it does offer most other features that you might expect from a DS emulator. It even supports GBA backwards compatability! I'm doing this for fun and as a learning experience, and also because I'm a huge fan of the DS. It may not be a worthy competitor for the other DS emulators just yet, but I believe that I can get it there someday. If not, that's fine too; like I said, I'm just having fun!

      Note: BIOS and firmware files dumped from a real DS console are required to use NooDS.
